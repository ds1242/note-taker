  ## About/Description

  This application allows a user to write and save notes.  The notes are written to a JSON file so they can be retrieved anytime.  The application front end was already written so I worked to create the routes on server.js which implemented the functionality of the webpage.  This application uses express for the routes to function.   I also added uuid to the project to generate a unique id each time a new note is created.  This allows for the id on each note to help identify the index in the array when using the delete function of the app.  Finally this application uses Heroku to deploy to a live environment.
